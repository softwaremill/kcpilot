## Frequently Asked Questions

### Installation & Setup

**Q: Do I need to install anything on my Kafka brokers?**  
A: No, KafkaPilot only requires SSH access. All tools are run remotely through SSH connections.

**Q: What permissions does KafkaPilot need?**  
A: Read access to configuration files, log files, and ability to run system commands like `ps`, `df`, `free`. Most operations work with standard user permissions.

**Q: Can I run KafkaPilot on Windows?**  
A: Yes, through WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Native Windows support is planned for future releases.

### Usage & Troubleshooting

**Q: Why isn't KafkaPilot discovering my brokers?**  
A: Check that `kafkactl` is installed on your bastion host and can connect to your cluster. Run with `--debug` for detailed logs.

**Q: How much data does KafkaPilot collect?**  
A: Typically 10-50MB per broker, depending on log file sizes and retention settings. Large clusters may generate 100-500MB total.

**Q: Is it safe to run in production?**  
A: Yes, KafkaPilot only performs read operations and doesn't modify any Kafka configurations or data.

**Q: How often should I run health checks?**  
A: For production clusters, daily automated checks are recommended, with on-demand scans during incidents.

### AI Analysis

**Q: Do I need an OpenAI API key?**  
A: Only for AI-powered analysis. Basic data collection and static analysis work without it.

**Q: What data is sent to OpenAI?**  
A: Configuration files, log excerpts, and metrics. No sensitive data like topic contents or user credentials.

**Q: Can I use other LLM providers?**  
A: Currently only OpenAI is supported. Support for other providers (Claude, local models) is planned.

### Integration & Automation

**Q: Can I integrate KafkaPilot with my monitoring system?**  
A: Yes, use the JSON report format to extract metrics and findings for your monitoring stack.

**Q: How do I automate KafkaPilot scans?**  
A: See our [CI/CD integration tutorial](tutorials.html#9-cicd-integration) for examples with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and other platforms.

**Q: Can I create custom analysis tasks?**  
A: Yes, see the [custom analysis tasks tutorial](tutorials.html#8-custom-analysis-tasks) for details.
