# KafkaPilot

**CLI-first Kafka health diagnostics tool for production environments**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Innovation Hub Project**: This project is part of [SoftwareMill's Innovation Hub](https://softwaremill.com/innovation-hub/) and is currently in MVP stage. While functional, it may contain bugs and has significant room for improvement. We welcome feedback and contributions!

## Intro

KafkaPilot is a comprehensive Kafka health diagnostics tool that automatically collects cluster signals, identifies issues, and provides actionable remediation guidance. Built for operations teams and DevOps engineers managing production Kafka clusters.

KafkaPilot is fast and production-ready. The SSH-based collection system is designed for zero-downtime diagnostics, while our AI-powered analysis engine provides intelligent insights into cluster health and performance bottlenecks.

```bash
# Scan your Kafka cluster in seconds
kafkapilot scan --bastion kafka-prod --output kafka-health-report

# Analyze with AI-powered insights
kafkapilot analyze ./kafka-health-report --report terminal
```

KafkaPilot integrates seamlessly with your existing infrastructure, requiring only SSH access and standard monitoring tools. No agents, no cluster modifications - just comprehensive diagnostics when you need them.

**Seamless integration with your Kafka operations workflow:**

- **All major SSH configurations are supported** - Works with your existing bastion hosts, SSH keys, and access patterns. This is especially useful for organizations with strict security requirements.
- **Zero cluster impact** - Read-only operations ensure your production environment remains unaffected during diagnostics.
- **Comprehensive reporting** - Generate insights in multiple formats: terminal output, markdown reports, and structured JSON for integration with monitoring systems.
